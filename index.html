                My Favourite meal is Black Soup.
                Black Soup is a popular and tasteful (Edo) Esan soup, it is quite delicious.
                I love it and i'm guessing you are going to love it too.
                I have been exploring food by other Nigerian ethnic groups and today we are going to 
                be making the popular Edo(Esan) Black soup
            </p>
            
            <p>It really doesn't matter your language or ethnic group,
            if you try the soup and get it right, you are going to have 
            the same experience as those that have been enjoying it for ages.
                Most people complain about the color ,it gets the color from the 
                ground leaves.It is super tasty and offers several health benefit.
                There are three basic leaves for making this delicious soup;
                bitter leaves,scent leaves(effirin) and uziza leaves.

        <h1>How to Cook Black soup
        </h1>
        <ol>
             <li>Grind all the leaves together,these ground leaves act
                as the soup thickner and also gives it the black-looking 
                color,hence the name - black soup. You can blend to paste
                by adding a little water to ease up the movement of the blades.
            </li>

            <li>Wash and boil the meat with half a cup of onions,1 seasoning cubes
                and a pinch of salt. Cook for 30=45 minutes, until the meat becomes
                soft and easily chewable, you can add a little water to stop it 
                from getting burned.
             </li>

            <li>Add the dry fish (hot-water-washed),stockfish,crayfish,
                add the banga sauce.
                </li>

                <li>Allow to cook for up to 15 minutes until the soupy mixture thickens.
                    </li>

            <li>Add the ground leaves,stir,add 2 seasoning cubes,salt to taste,
                allow to simmer for another five minutes and you are done
